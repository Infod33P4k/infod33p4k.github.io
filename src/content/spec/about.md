# 🧑‍💻 About

I’m [Deepak S.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d3p4k/), a cybersecurity professional and penetration tester passionate about safeguarding the digital world through continuous learning, hands-on practice, and real-world application.  

---

I hold the **Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP)** credential, along with the **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** from Hack The Box and the **Certified Penetration Tester (CPT)** from Red Team Hacker Academy. These certifications reflect my commitment to mastering offensive security techniques and applying them in meaningful ways.  

My expertise spans **web application penetration testing, Active Directory exploitation, and red teaming engagements** that simulate sophisticated adversaries. Beyond technical testing, I focus on building **automation tools** to streamline reconnaissance and post-exploitation, enabling faster, more accurate security assessments. I have also contributed to **infrastructure hardening** by translating findings into practical security improvements.  

I actively challenge myself through **CTF-style labs** and platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, which help me sharpen problem-solving under pressure. Currently, I am preparing for the **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** exam to expand my capabilities in advanced adversary simulation.  

What drives me is curiosity and the pursuit of impact: whether **reverse-engineering obfuscated payloads, uncovering complex business logic flaws, or automating multi-stage attack chains**, I approach every challenge with precision and persistence. My mission is simple — to turn vulnerabilities into opportunities for organizations to build stronger, more resilient security.
